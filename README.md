## Welcome!  
This repository is my personal roadmap and collection of projects in **quantitative finance, financial engineering, and machine learning in finance**.  

I created this space to organize resources, document hands-on projects, and explore advanced topics in the quant space. If you're someone interested in finance, machine learning, or building trading models â€“ I hope you find something useful here!
